# ⭐ Star Patterns in Java

This repository contains a collection of **star pattern programs written in Java**, implemented using **nested loops**.  
It is useful for **beginners**, **exam practice**, **viva preparation**, and understanding **loop logic & pattern design**.

---

## 📌 Features

- Implemented using **pure Java**
- Each pattern is written as a **separate static method**
- Easy to enable/disable patterns from `main()`
- Covers **basic → advanced** pattern logic
- Clean console output

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

**Language**
- Java

**Concepts**
- Nested `for` loops  
- Methods  
- Console output  
- Pattern logic  

---

## 📂 Project Structure
- StarPatterns.java


All patterns are implemented inside a **single class** for simplicity.

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Compile the program - javac StarPatterns.java
3. Run the program - java StarPatterns
